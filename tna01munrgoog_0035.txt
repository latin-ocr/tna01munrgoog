AETNA

Foun elaborate editions of this short poem have appeared at very
different periods during the last three centuries, three of them extending
to hundreds of peges each: the other, first alike in time and merit,
though of much less bulk than its succoesors, looks formidable enough
when compared with the text which it illustratos. A few months ago
nothing was farther from my thoughts than this poem: towards the
end of last October Ι had the pleasure of collating for Professor Ribbeck
a manuscript of the Culex in our public library3 and on finishing itI
looked through the Aetna which came efter3 and soon found on com·
paring it with Jacob's edition that it surpasscd other collated manu-
scripts in merit at least as much as *in age 3 that it supplied several
entire verses wanting in them, and oftener still half lines or single
words, making sense at once of passages hitherto unintelligible and
hopelessly corrupt. Stimulated by this I made a transcript at leisure
hours during November of the whole poem, copying the manuscript
page by page. Afterwards while absent from Cambridge in the mouth
of J anuary I formed from this copy a provisional text, appending to it
a complete collaticn of this codex and adding from Jacob a digest
of the readings of his two manuscripts, the Helmstsedt and the
Breslau. At the same time I gave aa minute an account as I could of
the variatione of the mysterious lost Florentino fragment bya eareful Ἄ
examinationes the two printed sources from which they are to be¹ ⁵
“ gotten‚ both of which I had and have before me. Having further
ascertained that the British Museum contained two manuscripts of our
poem I made an accurate collation of them in the mouth of J anuary.'
From these sources are derived the various readings which appear below
my text A fuller description of them shall be given after I have first
said a few words of the various editions which in forming my own Ι
have had the power or the will to consult rho explanatory com·'
mentary forms the largest part of my edition: something of the sort Ι
found to be necessary for my own nonacrim, much of the poem being
so obscure and so corrupt that often Ι could not tell whether I unden-
