fluuium et montom Casium dicitur peruenisse atque ibi in cypressum

arborem commutatus’. Statius Theb. ιν 289 ‘ot qui tibi, Pythis, Iadon
Paene socer' 3 837 ‘Te nec Apollineus Iadon’. Galen in his decompos
medic sec. locos 1, chap l near the end, vol 111 p. 421-426 Kiihn,
describes a grosse very efficacious in curing baldnesa The recipe was
found after the owner's death, ἐν unsri& διφθέρᾳι it was written in
figurative languags not easy to interpret Galen attempts this with
apparent succees; but yet with regard to each of the other ingrediente
ho will only say ‘I think it means so and so'; as when he acutely
explains ‘a pound of fat from ashapeless child' to maan a pound ol'
grease from a young bear before its mother had licked it into shspe
One of tha ingrediente however, p. 423, is λοδονιλος φύλλων tecla
χυλοῦ, of which he says, p. 426, Mdovtdoe δὲ, ὅτι τῆς δάφνης λέγει, οὐκ ἂν
οἶμαί τινα διοπορῆσοιε so world-renowned at that time was the daughter
of Ladon. By whom chiefly or when she got this renown I cannot tell:
perhaps πολλοὶ ψεύδονται ἀοιδοί, was all that could he said for the poeta
of Antioch The legend Ι doubt not was coevol with the foundation ot*
the city, and connected somehow with the family of Seleucus But the
Muscum of Antioch appears to have been of later celebrity. Cicero, pro
Archia 4, speaking οἱ this native ol Antioch says ‘se adscribendi
studium contulit, primum Antiochiae (nam ibi natus est nobili loco),
celebri quondam urbe et copiosa atque eruditissimis hominibus liberalis-
simisque studiis affluenti’. Archiae among others may have helped to
give the story its great celebrity: Ovid did not lrnow or neglectsd this
form of the legend. A comparison of the readings and commento ol
Scaliger, Gorallus, Wernsdorf and J acob would I think commend mine.

7 Pierio: I'am not sure that this has not ιοΐολιλοο to Antioch
and Daphne: north of them and the Orontes was a district and a moun·
sain both named Pieria: Strabo p. 749 Ἀντιόχεια ἦ ἐπὶ Δάφνῃ καὶ
Σελεύκεια ἦ ἓν Πιερίᾳε Plinyv 79 ‘dein promunturium Syriae Anti·
ochiae intus ipsa Antiochia libers Epidaphnae cognominata Oronte Ι

Strabo p. 751 πράς θαλάττῃ δὲ τούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Σελεύκεια καὶ ἠ Πιερία, ὅρος
συνεχὲς τῷ Ἀμιανῷ. diutius: it is strange ιο many editions should
prefer the ill-attested cautius.

9-28: the golden age and the legenda of old times have been sung
eo osten, that they are se familiar as our own times to us all I cssay
something more real: to explain the movements and tho fires of Etna—
The thought in these vsa. is sn expansion of the opening lines of the 3rd
georgic. 9 ιοοιννίε an epithet expressing the chief blessing of the
golden aga 11 fructibus: the sncprhus of ις and all editions is
manifestly interpolated: Forcellinus will give ἱλιιλλοοι frum Oicero and
others offtuotus applied to all the produce of the greum: Cos. bell.
