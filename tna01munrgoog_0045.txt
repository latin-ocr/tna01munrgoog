001 poem then was written before 79, and ae I cannot anyhow believe
it to be older than the silver age, its time would exaotly tally with the
time 01 Lucilius. The poem too ie evidently written by one who was
well acquainted with Etna and ite neighbourhood, and had seen ite
eruptione and their consequencee: now Lucilius wae long governor 01
Sicily. I find too more than one indication that the writer bad a
practical knowledge 01 wer and public business More than 01100111 the
commentaryI have noted how fond he is 01 comparing the ravages 01
Ε1110 with those 01011 enemy. The most curicus passage 10464-474,
which e first rendere intelligihle: to the poet, a spectator 01 the scene,
Etna suggests the notion 01 0 victorious enemy attacking the terrified
bystanders at the same time with missiles and at close quartem The
picture looks ae if drawn by a practised observor 01 battles, not by a
mere closet-poet Now Lucilius would appear, ae we said above, to 11010
served under Lentulus Gaetulicus commender in Upper Germany, at
that time one of the best schools 01 Roman war, where he might have
hed many opportunities 01 eeeing the barbaricus falling under the eworde
and missiles 01 the legions and strewing the field 01 battle inthe manner
here described The curicus metaphor 100 in 278 258 259 01111100 010

Lucilius had some close connexion with these parts. All this shews 01

Besides the passage about 111110 111 Seneca’s 79111 epistle which we
have discussed above, Wernsdorf and Jacob 10 prove the author 10 be
Lucilius allega the 1001 as they say that he was an epicurean and the
writer 01 the poem was an epicuream This question they treat with
great carelessness and confusion 01 thought: Jacob 101010 10 no less
than seven passages 10 prove thet the poet was a follower 01 Epicurus.

the other two passages directly disprove what he aeserta Not to dwell
cn minor points, there are three' passages in the poem, each distinctly
enuntiating a leading stoical doctrine: first, 33-35, where the divinity
