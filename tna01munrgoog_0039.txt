enumerated 11 the new catalogue, vol. 111 p. ros-706: Igive here some
details not mentioned there. ⁸

The volume we now have is but half tho original manuscript: it
commences with quaternion1x: the quaternione are all marked at the
bottom 01 the last page 0100011, rx x x1 x111111: then follow 1 leaves 01
the next one: the last leaf has its lower half cut off: it contained no
doubt the pertrait of the 00111100 001 00011011,1111011 has been piliered by
001110 unsorupulous collector. 001 poem occupies 33 peges, 111 the last
two leaves 01 0001010101 111, the whole 01 xm, the next six 100100, and
the first page 01 the last* imperfect leaf: page one contains the heading
01 the poem and 19 101000,11101011 31 0011011 20 verses each, the last
page bas 6 verses 01 the poem and the subscription lhe lines in this
edition 010 numbered in the order they come in a which has 645 verses:

into our libr-ary with the rest 01 Bishop More of Ely’s magnificent col-
lection in 1715 3 and is the codex Eliensis cited by Davies in his Oioero
denatura: it cannot boletar than the 10th century 3 and appears to
hare been written in England, as some 01 the modern poems in it are
concerned with the literary squabbles 01 this country. Indeed Mr
Bradshaw our Idbrarian thinks it possible that in piece ’1 ‘versus L de
quodam superbo', the L is lantfredus or henfridus, a disciple 01 Bishop
Ethelwold 01 Winchester, 01 that time the chief 0001 01 English learning.
If this be so, our ms. cannot he earlier than the end 01 the 10111 century:
10 010 11 appears 10 be earlier. It is beautifully and 101 the age accu-
rately written3 the words are correotly divided‚ except that, in con-
formity with the ancient pronunciation, the atonics, such 0001, qai, 000,
and the monosyllabic propositione are often united with the word that
follows: odora ct for odor 00100010 eruditas for 000100 meus, cycr
01000100 101 operef 000100, 11010110 olidum for 1001001 celldara stand quite
by themselves. There are few contractione, except those which are '
common in the oldest and best codices: thus we often, but by no means
always, meet with the usual abbreviatione 01 per, pro, 0100000, est,
quod, 01 the final m, and mm in the middle 01 words, ’01 -101 11 the pre
sent passive, and -bcs in the dat. or abl. plur. Single or rare instanoes 01
ds, oras, ⁸15⁸, 1111011111, 011110 (01100110) occur. The spelling is on the
whole very good 'aud I have followed it in all but palpable corruptions:
0101 humor and sulphur I heve retained as they may be from the
author: barbarisms like Aethrae, 0001010, mestas, inficior are very rare:
milio is spelt rightly: millio once where the reading is otherwise cor-

rupt: ce is generally correotly given 01000ρο and the like being the
exceptione. With good reason then, 00 already observed‚ Ihave noted
its minutest variatione The manuscript has been corrected throughout,
but at rare intervals, by 0 contemporary hand: oand p, 0 andr, rt and
