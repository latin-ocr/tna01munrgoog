recent forms. From Quintilian oue would infer that many forms had
gone out of use, which 660 best mss. of 660 elder Pliny, Juvenal and
others shew to have been employed by their respective authors: thus

all editions from wrong stopping and the fact that cessat is corrupted in
o: the passage is obscure: ‘then peace was restored to the shy, which
then was free and at rest: this peace came by the help of the stars:
heaven and the honour of the sky’s defence are‘now assigned to the
