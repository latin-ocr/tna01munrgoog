poet recommends the ‘verissima dicta' of Heraclitus’ obscure book, thet
firc was the end oi all things and the clement of all things: his subse
quent imitatione ef the language ol' Lucretius no more shcw him to be

Lucilius appears to have been a men ol‘ literar-y and philosophical
testes, given to much and multifarious reading: epist. 2 2 ‘illud autem
uide ne ista lectio auctomm multorum et omnis generis uoluminum
habeat aliquid uagum οι instabile’: without as yet a fixcd creed, bul
anxious ιο have one; ready ιο ιο convinced by the arguments of Seneca
and accepting much oi what ιο lays down, but still, ss we cen sec from
the very last ol Seneca’s letters, refusing ιο accept some oi the most ex-
treme stoical pmadoxee That during any period oi their correspond-
euce Lucilius wasa preiessed epicurean, Ido not believe: even in the
earliest letters Seneca often speaks cf Epicurus and his sect, ‘as he could
hardly have done to an intimate friend who was at the same time a
decidcd epicuream Yet frum sereral indicatione it would appear that
Lucilius was favourably inclined to this school: once, epist 23 9, Seneca
writes ‘vocem tibi Epicuri tui reddere': compare the ‘Ouidius tuus'
alreadyspokcn oi ι in the 107th epistle we have ‘Epicurus nosler’: the
esch epistle too has more than one expression, indicating some relation
between Lucilius and Epicurus. But all this is very far from showing
that Lucilius was a professed believer in Epicurus 3 and indeed from first
ιο last Seneca writes in a way that seems to me ιο contradict such a
supposition: no epicurean could have held the doctrines about provi-
deuce, the gods etc. which Seneca attributes to his friend even attha
beginning of their correspondcnee. It seems clear enough then thet
Lucilius was, like many of his countrymcn‚ en eclectio, witha distaste
lor the iron consisteney ol the Greek speculative spirit3 finding much
to approve and something ιο dislike in each of the rival schools of Epi-
curus and the Porch, then the most popular systema in Rome. Seneca
himself shrunk from scmeof the extremest stoicel paradoxas and owed
much to the more human and humane teaching of Epicurus We learn
from Gellius that there vereat hest two more books of Seneca's letters
to Lucilius ; but et the end of the twenty extant Lucilius is still a
doubter of the truths of stoicism. Howcver it is possible enough thet
further reflexion and the subsequent death of Seneca may have produced
full conviction in the generous spirit of Lucilius. If then there was
