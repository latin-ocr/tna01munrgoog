admirabilis fuit; siquidem mater eius Laudice, cum nupta esset Antio-
cho claro inter Philippi duces uiro, uisa sibi est per quietem ex concu-
bitu Apollinis concepisse grauidamque factam cet. Ubi ⁸post mortem
Alexandri occupato regno orientis urbem condidit, ibi quoque geminae

originis memoriam consecrauit. nam et urbem ex Antiochi patris
nomine Antiochiam uocauit et campos uicinos Apollini dicauit '. Seleu-
cus in 300 ac. founded attha same time Antioch, which Chrysostom a
native proudly terme theudam} καὶ μήτηρ of all the cities of the east,
and at five miles distance, highsr up the Orontes, the park and sanctuary
of Daphne which Chrysostom, Ammian and others so often eall a suburb
of Antioch. Daphne was no less femous than Antioch, which on coins,
in inscriptions and books is as often called Antioch by Daphne, Antioch

of Daphne, as Daphne is termed Daphne by Antioch: καὶ πάντα ἢν ἤ .

Δάφνη Σελεύκῳ, says Libauius in his Antiochicus chrysostom, while
invidiously connecting the eerthly Daphne with the heavenly J erasa
lem, cannot conceal what charum it had for the children of this world ⁴
Το Antioch and Daphne was transplanted the whole worship of Apollo:
unable to create, the Syrien Greeks brought hither the very names
of old Hellas, Castalia and the like : sn omphalos, far larger than that of
Delphi, was set up by Antiochus Epiphanes or Epimenes in the middle
tetrastylon of his great central street of colonnades Ausonius, declar.
urb. 3, says ‘Phoebeae lauri domus Antiochia‘

But on the banks of the Orontes Daphne was always called daughter
of Ladon: nay the very river was transferred to Syria, like Castalia.
Whyi was Laodice connected with the Peloponneso and the parts of it ‚
where the Ladon flowedf Much else was brought from thence to Syria
On the hill Silpion avas an old Syrien Ione, on which Seleucus Nicator
sacrificed to Zeus Ceraunios in the spring of 300, before founding
Antioch. This gave rise to the notion of an Argive-Athenian colony
sent to recover Io, and to other testeless perversioris of the genuine my-
thology. Ladon isa fine river, but not better than twenty others in the
‘great Dorian island of Pelops’; and in the unperverted legend was
known as father of Metope famous in the mythical history of Thebes
and Hellas: see Pindar olymp. v1 and his scholiast, and Diodorus 1v7 2.
Even in Ovid and Hyginus we know Daphne only as daughter of
Peneus. But Antioch changed all this: Pausanias vm 201 thus writes:
d δὲ Λάδων ποταμῶν τῶν ἐν Ἑλλάδι ὕδωρ παρέχεται κάλλιστον, ἔχει δὲ καὶ
ἄλλως ἐς ἀνθρώπους φήμην καὶ τά ᾀδόμενα ἔς τὴν Δάφνην. τοῦ λόγου δὲ
τοῦ ἔς Δάφνην τοὶ μὲν Συρίοις τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐπὶ Ὀρόντῃ ποταμῷ παρίημι
κτλ, What was told by the Syrians on the Orontes? Philostratus in
his life of Apollonius1 16 p. 19 will throw sonis light on this: ἔπεφοίτησε
καὶ Ἀντιοχείᾳ τῇ μεγάλη πεπαυμένος τοῦ σιανπιῖν, καὶ παρῆλθεν ἔς rd ἶερόν
τοῦ Δαφναίου Ἀπόλλωνος, ᾧ περιάπτουσιν Ἀσσύριοι τὸν μῦθον τᾶν Ἀρκάδα·
