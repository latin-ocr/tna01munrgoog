‘sic at Pithecussas [i. e. Aenaria] in Campano sinu fer'unt ortas3 mox
iu his montem Epopon, eum repente flamma ex eo emicuisset, cam·
pestri aequatum planitie': insidias means much tho same as repente of
Pliny. 430 Ifollow a: ααιὶιιοιο depende on Dicatur. saper, i.e. et

gInning ὑπέρκειται δὲ τῆς πόλεως εὗθῦςῆ τοῦ Ἡφαίστου dyopo', πεδίον
περικεκλειρένον διαπύροις ὄφρύσικαμινῶδεις ἐχούσαις dramatis πολλαχοῦ

what precedes; and Petronius 120, v. 67 ‘Est loeus exciso penitus de·
mersus hiatu Parthenopen inter magnaeque Dicarchidos ὀιοο, οοι.’
Petronius was probably contemporary with our author. 432 ιιι ubera
to express its great plenty: see the last words quoted from Strabo· ⁴
433 fecundius seems to agree with abac, rather than suptar. 434
Insula cet. the third of haec loca. ltotaada of mss. Ι keep, though
Scaliger and later editors read Rotundus: comp. Ovid met. 1 169 ‘Lactea
nomen habet'; xvl40 ‘Insula nomen habet'; and still more like our
passage, l.l. 96 ‘actas eui fecimus aurea nomen’; Sueton. v 24 at end,
‘Gabinio Secundo...eognomen Cauchius usurpare eoncessit': Rotunda
is the Greek Στρογγύλη. it and Hiera next mentioned arc both described
as active volcanoes by Diodorus v 7.

435 and 436 are both given rightly hy a done. 436 Et apis: a
stonet oo helps, well suited for kindling fires, but yet without the proper-
ties cf the true molaria of Etua: Diod. 1. l. ἐκφυσᾶται δὲ και ἄμμος καὶ
λίθων διαπύρων πλῆθος. 439 Insula, the fourth of these places: it is
called Ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου by both Diodorus and Strabo. durat adhuc of
Scaliger, adopted by later editors, has no meaning, as he aud the rest
understand the sentence: they take iacertdi of 440 ιο bo a genitive
and join it with what follows: ‘the greater part of the conflagration
has oooled down’: what follows proves that Patra is ρανιι insulae, as
otherwise 440 and 441 have no senso: tacendi is the infin. ι. ‘the
island, but a part cf it only, still continues ιο burn: the greater
portion eta': duro could take an infin. in our author's age: Patron. 41
‘durani interrogare': Lucan 1νῦῙο ‘ut uiuere durent’: the last syll.
of adhuc might easily be absorbed in the foll. word 3 but perhaps adbuc
ἀινναι was what the poet wrote. 445 ιι alone preserves the end of
this va the fact of a connexion between the Lipari islanda and Etna
seems ιο be still a moot point: see Daubenyp 264. 446 alantque:
comp. 385 and 11. there. 447 pasceret is clearly needed.

448-5092 but you may see for yourself that this lava rs the chief
agent ιιι eruptions: look at its effect all round the mountain: it involves
all other materiale in its own fierce conflagration3 it is dangerous for
any to approach the scene of action ; some of tho stones will burn away
toa cinder 3 but the great stream of lava advances, miles in breadth‚
