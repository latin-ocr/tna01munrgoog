any positive evidence in favour of his being the author of our poem, the
various points I have discussed would to my mind rather increase than
diminish the probability. But there is no such evidence ; and though
Lucilius might seem to have a somewhat better claim than any other
single name, yet, as between him and the whole Romm world, the
chauces must be great against him. ‘Aetna’ therefore still remeius and
I fancy ever will remain the work ‘incerti auctorie'.

Our poem ia on the whole singularly unattraetive and of meagre
merit enough: the poet seems to have been urged ιο his task not by the
muse, but by a most eonscientioua desire to enlighten an ignorant world
on the true causes of the eruptione of Etua and the real nature of the
much misunderatood lava-stone. More than half the poemia taken up
with describing at most vexatious length first the many ways in which
wind and air help to reuse the subterranean fires, and then the manner
in which the ‘lapis molaris’ is really snaed. The first 90 verses are
formal and have a strong twang of the school ; the concluding episode oi
the Oetanian brothers is suff aud constrained, and quite fails of the
pathos it is intended to produce. Perhaps the best lines in the poem,
aa Jacob has remarked, are aaa-269, which touch on a theme suited
to the Roman tone of thought 3 and, for similar reasons, 568-598, As
I have already said, our (lambridge manuscript is my aole inducement
ιο publish this edition: it seemed ιο me, considering the good age of the
poem, worth while ιο give it. to the world in an improved shape. Its
attractione are too small ιο make me care to keep it longer by me and
try to correct more completely its exceedingly corrupt text I give it
therefore to the world well aware how much hae yet to be done3 how
much, that appears to me satisfactory, will be found defective by intelli·
gent readers As another edition of such a poem is not likely to be
called for, if on subsequent reflexion anything new might occur or
should critica publioly or privately suggest to me corrections, I might
by aud bye add these in the form of an appendix to the present work

One more pointI have here ιο touch upon. As soon asI had be·
gun ιο revise the poem, I looked about for what might help my pur·
pose. Ascertainiug that Professor M. Haupt had written two programs
on the poem, I sought of course at once ιο obtain them. By an un-
lucky accident they were neither in my own libr-ary nor in any library
public or private, so far aa I could learn, in Cambridge, Oxford or lon-
don. My booksellers after some delay obtained for me the· second one
of 1859, from which I have got one brilliant emendation: the earlier
one of 1854 was reported from Berlin and other places aa wholly out of

print. It has only just been procured for me after long advertising. . ’
