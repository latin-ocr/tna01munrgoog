und the lllyriau pesses3 the tymnny of (leina had not been able
to force him to abendon Gaetulicus, nor the freedmen of Claudius
made him unfaithfnl to other friends. &neca whose letters appear to
have been written in old age, calls him a ‘iuuenis’ in contrust with hirn-
self Butes he must bave arrived at years of discretior in 39, when
Gaetulicus perished, he must have passed the age of forty some years
before Seneou's death Seneca speaks of his philosophical testes, and
these ere sufficiently proved by the whole tenour of their correspondenoe.
He also calls him ‘my pcet' and cltes several of his verses3 and iu the
79th letter, of which we have already spoken, he allodes to Lucilins'
desigu of describing Etna in his poem, a trite topic with poeta, as Ovid
had done after Virgil, Severum after Ouid: ‘aut ego te non noui aut
Aetna tibi saliuam mouet: iam cupis grande aliquid et par prioribus
scribere’. This passage implius that Etna was to form an episode in
some poem, as it hed done in the Aeneid, the metamorphoseis and the
work of Cornelius Severus, and would seem at first sight tc cppese the
olaims of Lucilius as much as those of Severus. But there is this
difference: the poem of Severus was already written, that of Lucilius
was not; aud as bis materiale and interest in the subject increased, be
may have chosen to write an independent work on Ezoa Would then
the age of our poem agree with that of Luciliusl exacfly, Ithink: for 1
have no doubt it belongs to the silver age. When itis freed from the
barbarous rhythms introduced into it by Scaliger, Gorallus, Wernsdorf κ
and ,J acob, its technical style is exactly that of Lucan and other poets
who formed themselves on the model of Ovid3 and I cannot but think
it was written before Vel. 'Flaccus Statius and Silius had set the fushion
of slavishly copying Virgil’s thoughts and language: our poem, small as
its virtues arc, is independent enough on the whole in its matter and
manner. That Lucilius was fond of Ovid would appear from Seneca ,
nat. quaest ΝΞ 2 ‘quare non cum poeta meo iocor et illi Ouidium suum
impingo'. It contains however I think still more positive evidence of
its age: Wernsdorf has noted that the artifioiul Triton mentioned in
293 seems to allude to a mechanical contrivance of the age of Claudius 3
and he and Jacob allega this as a certain proof that the poem was not
written before this time. Very likely the poet may allude to this very *
machine 3 but this is by no means certain, as I have shown in my notes Ἴ
to the passage that similar Tritone, as well as water-organa, are described
by Heron of Alexandria long before. Again the writer, anxious to
illustrate his subject in every way, carefnlly describes all the extinctor
nearly extinct volcauoes he knows, those of the Aeolian islanda, Ischia, ,
and the region between N aples and Cumae which he had himself in· ⁴
