whether he has not now proved his point, the only point he has proved 2
being that he does not understand what he is talking about But what
I have said by no means applica to all the notee; nor can any one 3
dispute that he has often rightly emended the corrupt text: he has l
employed too much more judiciously than Wemsdorf the florentine

788111111001000010 the manuscripts which I have made uso of: as =

already said, this poem should never have been edited by me, ifI had ἵ
not met with the manuscript in our public ⁶library, Klrv34, numbered l
2076 in the new catalogue. This codex is so much superior 10 all other l

existing codices both in age and in merit, that not only have I grounded
my text mainly on it, but as in duty bound have noted the minutest
discrepancies of spelling: Icall it a Besides aI have collated, and so ’
far as I know hare been the first 10 collate, two manuscripts in the
British Muscam: one which Ι call γ forms part of Arundel 133, a large
folio in double columns: the Aetna begins at leaf 921» and ends at 96 b: l
the lst column has 38 lines besides the heading, the last page contains ¹

14 lines, all the other columns have 39 lines each. This codex is of the
15th century, but belongs 10 the less interpolated class 01 late mss. and
is extremely like, though I think on the whole rather better than
Jaccb's ms. 3, which Ι denote by e: my critical notes will shew fully
their relation to each other. The second codex which Ι name t, is ¹
Sloane 777, art. 6, written cn vellum in a small Italian hand late in the

⁵ 15111 century. It belongs to the more interpolated class of mss. and
ascribes the poem to Cornelius Severus which γ gives 10 Virgil: it
departs however less from o and the better mss. than Scaliger’s worth-
less codex and the early printed copies do. Το these mss. Ihave joined

J ecob’s two, bis H which I call δ, and his 3 which Ι call a 8 was ccl-
lated for him by Lachmann5 and therefore, we may feel sure, with

accurecy. Though itis dated so lateas1470,8iathe beet of the infe-
tiermes, better on the whole I think than γ and ε, much better than ζ,
01 the early editions ,· though, compared with α, it is tc be reckoned
merely among these. s is assigned 10 the 14th century by one Krantz,
tc the end 01 the l3th by one Wachler, aa I leam from Hand, Stat. silv.
p. xxv: according tc Hand itis the best extant ms for Statius’ silvae,
but it must I think belong really tc the 15th century. The variatione
01 γ ὃεζ Ι have not given of course with the same minuteness as those 01
a: it would have been mere waste of space, and worse, 10 have done so.
It is perhaps only the shortness cf the poem that excuses my citing even
so much from them: usually, where they agree entirely 01 essentially
with one another, Ι deuote them by o, as I shall explain below. Before
Icome 10 the lost Florentine fragment which Icall β, Ι must describe a
more fully: the different pieces which the manuscript contains are
