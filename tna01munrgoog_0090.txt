10 spite 01 her terror: perhaps in the last ν. there was something to
which this refers, such as ‘matrem ille labantem’: Claud ib.9 ‘Nonne
010100 01 saeua senex incendia monstret, Vt trepido genetrix innocet ore
deosl Erexit formido comam perque omne metallum Elisus 1001100110
palluit aere tremor’: or else we must read ‘Tutus uterque pio sub
pondere sufficit illo'. , 640 comp 00000, eto cited above, and Pausan.

v111 14 ‘lllum et securi cimumspexere fragorem Elysii’3 x 88 ‘Secu-

‘Secretusque pios, his dantem iura 001000ιο ’, and read Sacratae.

¹ As I promised in the introduction‚ I append some remarks on
Professor Haupt‘s prognem 01 18540 p. 3 he thus emenda 51 soll:
Inpius et miles metuentia comminus astra Prouocat, admotis ad territa
sidera signis Prouocat infestus cunctos ad proelia diuos Iuppitere
caelo metuit dextramque corusca Armatus flamma cet: ad 1000110010,
he says, 0 0000001100 01 Εο0001000 Wassenberghins: the transposition 01
52 and 53 is his 0000 0 caele metuit he defends by Propert. v 6 59
1ρο100 Idalio miratur Caesar ab astro': 10 me the context seems 10
require caelo enotuit: I prefer too the 0001000000 01011 mss P. 110 60
he reads ud for iu: but with iu bellurulum may we 001 compare such
expressions as Ovid her. 15197 ‘Non mihi respondent ueteres in 00010100
nires'‚ Aen. vn 664 ‘Pila manu saeuosque gemut in bella dolones’‚ and
‘in utrumque paratus’l 62 he reads 1αο0000 fersueuus: Ι prefer scueuus3
but both corrections at once occurred to me, aud would occur to any
' scholar: in tho same v. he proposes utrimque aecus for utrimque dua.
Iu 68 he adopts the reading 010 16111 century edition, 1101ρί000ον1
001001οο 100ρο110000 uictos: but that is surely rewriting‚ 001 correcting:
que 100 seems in that 0000 0 most inadequate connecting particle. I
do 001 see that 11 10 more absurd 10 picture Parth camied along in
the rout of her children, as she attempta to rally them, than 10
represent the 01000 as fighting on the side 01 heaven. P. 51019 he
proposes lunarum out or Ambustum au 100 Inpositam 01. P. 6 10 73
he prefers patulis of Aldus 76 he reads 0001000100 rerunt 77 uiyro
uiderunt agmine for nigros uider-uui omuino. P. 7 10 80 he proposes
strauere rmueuu 100 pecua strauere: 81 ponto for poeria: Ι could un-
derstand ‘sollicitant pontis ⁴sollicitentque aquis’ or ‘sollicitant 1000
