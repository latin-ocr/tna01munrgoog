did not understand it, until Ι had written down at length in what way
Ι proposed tc explain it This I hope will be found to be not the 10001
0001111 portion of this small work.

Our poem is found in some only of the earlier editions of Virgss3
and these appear to haye all essentially the same text, having been J
printed no doubt one from the other. Ι have before me two editions of
1475, Rubeus’ dated January of that year and Ienson's, both belonging y
10 our Thinity library: their texts are throughout the same in all but 1
quite unimportaut points, except that Ienson 111 514 has, probably from
conjecture, the correct manuscript reading 10010, while Rubeus and
Ι believe all other early editions have 00010. These then I have deemed
amply sufficient 10 represent the whole class, since, 00 might be expected ¹
iu 00 corrupt a poem, they follow the text 01 0 1010 and very interpolated
manuscript. 001 poem first appears in 0 greatly corrected form in the 1
Aldine edition of the catalecta and other minor poema dated December ³
1517. 110 011101000111111000111011 15341hsvenadbef0re me,

text: the secundis mostly 0 reprint 01 the first ; but yet has a good 1
many important variatione from it and in not 0 1011 cases is the first 00 1

were 10 be superseded by Scaliger’s Virgilii Appendix printed 01 Lyons 1

R before me one, Duport’s‚ 110111 our Trinity library has on the title-page

-. 1572; 1110 other 1573, which appears to be the usual date. Α second
edition was published 01 Leyden in 1595, with some changes and
additional remarks by Scaliger and the editor Lindenbruch. Anythiug
coming from Scaliger must display’learning, power and originality3 and
Ι (10 not think that any work of his on the Latin poeta has 111000
qualities in 0 higher degree than his notes on the Aetna. Its great
difficulty put him on his mettle3 110 poetry too had for him a singular
attraction: following the older Italian authorities, not the more cautious
Aldine editor, he attributed it to Ovid’s friend Cornelius Severus and
therefore 10 the age of Augustus 01 Tiberius: ‘quo neque post tempora
Tiberii (10000110 01111110 poema neque mendosius ullum ad nos peruenit '‚ ¹
he says at the end of his notes. The latter clause is true enough 3 the
former he will find few 10 approve. As 10 often seen in vigorous haters‚
his antipathy to Lucan made him contrast our poet favourably with
‘isti pingues Cordubenses poetae, Musarum farpdpnru'. He 001 himself
therefore earnestly at work 10 0011001 and explain our poem. Having
besides the printed editions only 0110 1010 and interpolated manuscript,
he must often from the nature of the 0000 go wide astray. Yet in not
a few instances with the glanae of genius he descries the truth through
