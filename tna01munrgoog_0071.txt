technioal involved description: but the clearest accounts are found in
Heron 1. l. and in the curicus poem of Publil. optatianus ap. Wernsdorf
poet. min. 11 p. 405 where the arrangement and length of the vss sug·
gcsts to the eye the arrangement of the tubes: 41 ‘Perque modos gra-
dibus surget fecunda canons Aere cauo et tereti, calamis crescentibus
aucta Quis bene suppositis quadratis ordine plectris Artificis manus iu
numeros clauditque aperitque Spiramenta' will illustrate our v.‚ and
what follows ‘Sub quibus unda latens properantibus incito uentis, Quae
uicibus crebris iuuenum labor cet', looks like 298, where aar. unda
seems a reminiscence of Aen.1227 ‘subremigat undis’: but the ‘arte
regentis Quae tenuem cet’ ¹must refer to the organist who is playing on
the keys and thus driving the air into the tubes so as to produce the
music: it would seem here simply to mean ‘ he rows along'‚ ie, plays on
the different keys, ‘by means of the water’, which supplies the pressure
by which the air is forced into the tubes; for all seem agreed that this
was the sole purpose of the water: Heron p. 229 vd δὲ ἔν τῷ βωμίσκῳ ὕδωρ
ἐμβάλλεται ἕνεκα τοῦ τᾶν περισσευόντα ἀέρα ἐν τῷ mysi, λέγω δὴ τὸν ἐκ τῆς
πυξίδας ὠθούμενον ἐπαίροντα vd ὕδωρ πρός ro* riti ἐχειντοῦς eihais δυναμένους
φθέγγεσθαι : Athen. l. l. says ἐμπνευστδν δ’ ἂν ἴσως ῥηθείη διὰ τὸ ἐμπνεῖσθαι
τὰ ὄργανον iud τοῦ thasos: he next goes on to describe how this is done
Pliny however, 1x 88, uses subremigo in its litersl sense of roving under-
neath: can theu the words imply here ‘he rows below upon the water’,
i. e. while he is playing above with his hands, he is mering something
below with his leet, which sets the water in motiont 299 justin the
same way the wind of Etna maddened at being dislodged by the torrente
of water fights in t'he streitoned raom, and thus Etna roars mightily like
the bucias of the Triton,'or the water-orgen, both like it moved by
water. summota sareas: see n. to 67. 301 not only are there these
external causes of wind in nens, but we must believe they are produced
below the earth from causes similar to those outsida 303 moment
is clearly right, mereant having no meaning here. prauum inter se is
the proper Latin construction in the sense of ‘mutuo premunt pre·
muntur’: Lucr. vr 456 ‘comprendunt inter se'; 1787 ‘inter se mutare,
where I give instances from Cicero, Caesar and Livy. 305 escaque
cet. must mean ‘and do not settle down until they are in a saie place':
but perhaps J acob's ‘tuta dum sede' is necessary: with que irc of oo for
dum, comp. 206 que cetra β rightly, destrc ao.

306-328: ii even you contest what I say, you must allow that
rocks tumble underground, and so cause a dispersion of air, and produce
wind: also that the moisture os mists produces air and wind as we see
on meadows near a river: much great& is the power of water under
the earth, and oi winds which by constraint are rendered more violent,
until they burst out with their fires from the crater of Etna. 307
