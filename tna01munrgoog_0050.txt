mentioned by Ptolemyv13 just before Κούριον, and the whole of the l
small peninsula oi Κούριον must hare been assigned to the worship of 2
Apollo Hylates: Steph. Byr. Ἀμαμασσός· πόλις Κύπρου ἓν ᾗ τιμᾶται J

the peninsula in question must have nrade this name of Apollo well·
known in Alexandri-ne and Roman times 'l'he name recalls what Pau· l
sanim 1132 6 says, speaking of Magnesia upon Maeander or Lethaeus,
ἔστι δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἐπὶ ποταμῷ Ληθαίῳ Μάγνησιν 'ula καλούμενον χωρίον·
ἐνταῦθα Ἀπόλλωνι dasiro: σπήλαιον, μεγέθους μὲν ἕνεκα ori πολλοῦ θαύ-
ματος, τδ δὲ ἄγαλμα τοῦ ’Λπόλλωνος rui μάλιστα ἆρχαῖονι the similarity τ
of names and worship would seem to imply some connexion. In pre-
Alexandrine times Cyprus was more than hali-barbarian: when it
became the chief possession of the Egyptian orown‚ doubtless Apollo
Hylates, little known to old Greece, would be celebrated by other Alex-
andrino writers besides Lycophron,—w1iters now lost but amesmble to
our author, who, as we shall often have occasion to see, was a man of ,
varied learning. ,
6 Ι now come to the Dodona of mss. which cannot be right, as
Apollo had no bassiness there. It once occurred to mo that Dardanio,
i'n the Roman sense, might be the right reading: the whole of that coast ,
teemed with his sanctuarios: comp. Strabo 618 ποροὶ πᾶσαν γάρ δὴ τὴν ,
παραλίαν ταύτην d Ἀπόλλων διατετίμηται μέχρι Τενέδου, Σμινθεΰς ἢ Κυλ-
λυῖος καλούμενος ἦ Γρυνεδς ἥ τινα ἄλλην ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχοντ Statius Theb. 1
699 in the middle oi a similar address, ‘Seu Troiam Thymbraeus habes'.
But the true reading I now feel sure is ludonis ‘the daughter of
Ladon’ : perhaps our author after some poet oi Antiooh may have used
the form Ladona on the analogy oi Hesiod's Ἀμφιτρυῶυη and similar
⁵ female patronymica What has just been said oi the poets and writers
of Alexandria, applies more strongly to those of Antioch and Daphne:
they have periched and deservedly so no doubt 3 yet there are many
testimoniet to shew that for six or seven centurias Daphne no't only in
splendour and beauty, but in sameas well, had taken the place of
Delphi, as chief sanctuary of Apollo. But it is notin Euripides or
Pindar that we read oi this: we have to go to Philostratus, Galen, Iibe-
niue, Ohrysostom, Sozomen, Nonum, Justin, Servius and the like. uhe
origin of Apollo's worship there is told by J ustin xv 41 ‘Seleucus
nouus Antigono hostis accusarat. huius quoque uirtus clara et origo
