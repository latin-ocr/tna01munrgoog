tremely frequent in Latin: comp. Madvig gram 310010 my n. 10
Lucr. 1 32700010200001111110 or potest aliquis, and 1141 Gwoe uideas:
uidemus or uidet aliquis: Madvig observes that this idiom 10 01 very ex-
tensive use, employed elika in the chief clauses 01 sentences, or» ²²⁸

here, after conjunctiora, si, 0001, 010, or relatives: the 1110011 10 so used 1

‘Quoad 1100100 possis’, where Iachmann's potia ee iano more necessary 1

then Jacob's credis here: the same idiom occurs below, 401 ‘si 10110

manu teneas ao...cernas,...putes’, where Jacob quite spoils the passage 1
by violent and useless changes: 100000 and 00100010 not depend on si 1
forte, but=tenemus, cernimus. 309 Ρ1011010 seems quite necessary: ,
the 0010110 tumble in, and the air thus displaced rushes about and f

rsises wind: Lucr. vr 545 ‘Subter ubi ingentis speluncas subruit aetas:
Quippe cadunt toti montes': this use 01 proruere appears in the 011101
age: Tac. 011. xv 22 ‘motu terrae..,0ppidum Pompei magna ex parte
