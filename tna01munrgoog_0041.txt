of a copy of Pithoeus' edition, Paris 1590 011 1111111111 of the title-
page was written ‘In Aetna V. significat eod. Florentinum, quem inde
habuit Ernstius, nempe solum partem illsm’. Matthiae thinks the
collationis not Ernstius'‚ but N. Heinsius’, as Burmann, nto Ovid
met. 1 85, gives two of its readings with these worda ‘sed legendum ex
antiquo codice Mediceo quem Heinsius contulit'. One Henr. Emetius
published in 1641 arery brief catalogue of the Iaurentian librar-y: in it
I find no mentiones this codex: he enumeratos merely the same mss. ol
Virgil which Bandini describes: Lucca would seem to be the place
where it really existed Ihave taken great paine to get from these two
sources as complete a collation as I could of this fragment of 1501ines=
it begins with v. 138 sud ends with 286: but we baveno account what-
ever of its condition, its age, its orthography3 for theone or two notahle
instances, as caussa, errautcis, which the collatione record, I feel con-
vinced come merely from the edition of Pithoeus, which so prints these
words: not one remarkable spelling I believe is given differing from
Pithoeus. Wernsdorf suspects its best readings and scarcely makes any
use of them: Jacob employs them often very unskilfully. Yet for this
part of the poem which chauces to be obscure, this fragment is quite
invaluable: many passages are not intelligible without it Το doubt
its essential genuineness is monstrous: in 150 vsa itgives ten times as
many brilliant and certain corrections of the other msa as a Scaliger can ,
make in the whole poem. Quite as incontestable in my opinion is its
superiority over s in these ves. as ia the superiority of c over all other
mss: when one finds so muchhere that can be understood only from β,
one trembles to think how much must remain uncorrected in the rest of
the poem. β gives us two lines, found in no other ms: as a in the other
parts gives us 3 or 4 other vss. which u, ie. all the other msa want, I
infer that to suppose alccuna of one or more vss. in some other difficult
passages is a legitimate and simple method of emendation. One certain
test, istest be wanted, of the genuineness ofp is this: in some of the
passages in which it is right u alone agrees with it, c ars all different:
in still more it is right or nearly so, then follows α, then come ω, much
farther than u from βε for examples of the first kind look at 230 uinclo‚

c too agreeing more with u than with β, as might be expected: thus in
