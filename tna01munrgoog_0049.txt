hand, 256 regnes 11 ω rightly, segne est βε 448 eolis crightly: nota 611 ξς,
116616γ8 ε. This et is a very 1111111111 source of corruption: I believe
for instance that in Propert 111 (11) 34 53 we should read ‘Nec sipost
Stygiae aliquid rest (1.1. 16 est) arbiter undas’: comp. ‘Sunt aliquid
manes’ and 1116 like. Probably in many cases where our maa now give
cat in full, our author wrote 11, as in 19 instances in which 611 now
occurs at the end 61 a verse 3 as well es in no 1611 than 38 instancoe
where a vowel or an m is elided before cet by our maa in other parte 01
the verse If the poet did 1161 always write the enclitio 11, he probably
meant us 1616 pronounce as in most of these cases an elision would 1161 be
admissible according to hir principles 61 versification which are moatly
Ovidium the preveiling lashion in his ege. Thus while quc or other
instances 61 ἔ ere freely elidad, more than 100 timee3 he is much more
chary in elidiug d or a syllable ending in m, and in the whole poem
there are hardly more than 20 cases 61 the elision of a long vowel; and
in these last as well as those 61 d and m a very large proportion of the
elisione occur between the first and 2nd foot or in the middle 61 the 4111,
where 1ο our teste and that of the ancients such elisione sounded lesa
hersh than elsewhere In other cases the elision was designed 16 pro-
duce some particular effect gratior: Mart 1v 44 5 ‘Haec Veneris sedes
. Lacedaemone gratior illi'.

Hyle is the same thing 11111611ιοί ιι, the aspirata 111611 and long
before being nothing and y and c' being interchangeable: thus 49 611111-
ρυε, 107 1111111111, and on the other hand 119 hyatu, 602 cyriaca 161
Sirius ι on the one hand ospitium, cccccccccc with Ιι written above, 66101
» baec, on the 611161661161611, chalcitide, Ιιασ 161 cc: see Ribbeck's proleg. 16
Virgil p. 422 423, 427, 452 and the authorities he cites: o writes
throughout aethna and cellmoacc. For Hyla compare Stephanus Byr.
e. 1. Ὕλη, πόλις Κύπρου ε’ν ἧ Ἀπόλλων τιμᾶται Ὺλότης. Λυκόφρων [448]

καὶ Σίτραχον elasam Ὺλίτου τε yria: where the scholiaet says Ὺλά- “

που· τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος· Ὗλη γὰρ ε’στὶ περὶ τόν Κούριον, τόπον τῆς Κύπρου,
ἱερὰ Ἀπόλλωνος, ἀφ’ ἧς Ὑλιίπην τόν θεόν προσαγορεύουσινε Eurum Il.
Ε 708 ἦν δέ φασι καὶ Λοκρικὴ πόλις Ὕλη, καὶ ἄλλη Κύπρου ἐφ’ ἧς καὶ

Ὺλότης Ἀπόλλων παρὰ Λυκόφρονι. These passages I quote at length,
because they are the only ones I know where 11111Ὕλη is mentioned by
name3 though Strabo p. 683 alludee 1ο the seme worship: εἶτα πόλις
Κούριον ὅρμον ἔχουσα, Ἀργείων κτίσμα. ἤδη ούν πύρεοτι σκοπεῖν τὴν
ῥαθυμίαν τοῦ ποιήσαντος τό ἐλεγεῖον τοῦτο οὗ ἦ ἀρχῆ Ἱραὶ τῷ Φοίβῳ
πολλόν διὰ κῦμα θέουσαι Ἢλθομεν αἱ ταχιναῖ τόξα φυγεῖν ἔλαφοι. εἶθ’
