favourite, notwithstanding a protest from Markland, inclined even to
undcrrate the merit and age of the poem, who declared with reason that
there was no resemblance between its style and that of the undoubtad
renrains of Severus. In truth the longest fragment, that 0125 verses on
the daath of Cicero preserved by tbe elder Seneca, has an Ovidian
fulness and eleaticity and easy flow which we look 101 in vain 111 any
part 01 our poem. His friend Orid addresses him as the ‘uates mag-
norum maxime 111111] and Quintilian, 1189, says that, though he
is a better versifico than poet, yet if the whole of his ‘bellum Siculum’
had been written like the 1111111001, he would have justly claimed
the second place among Roman heroicpoets, above Ovid himself.
Tharais uo doubt that the Italian scholar who first assigned the poem
to Seianas, was led 1ο do so solely through 1 passage in the 79111
epistle 01 Seneca, where ha is speaking 01 his friend Lucilius’ intention
to describe Etna in his poem, ‘hunc sollemnem omnibus poetis locum’:
‘quem quominus Ouidius tractaret nihil obstitit quod iam Vergilius
impleuerat: ne Seuerum quidem Cornelium uterque deterruit’. But
the natural meaning 01 Seneca’s words, as Wernsdorf hus seen, isthat
Severus had inserted 11 his ‘bellum Siculum’ a short cpisoda about 1
Etna, as Virgil had done 111 his Aenaid and Ovid in his metamorphcses. ¹
This passage therefore is by no means in favour 01 his claime, as our ¹
poem fenus a distinct and complete whole. These very words of
Seneca however led Wernsdorf, and 1111111101 induced Jacob and
many others tc 1111111111 unhesitatingly that Lucilius himself is the
author: with what truth we have next to examina. For theacla
purpose of throwing some light on this question Ihave read through the
whole of Seneca's letters. The results obtained Ihad intended at first
to state at some length 3 but Ihave since come to the conclusion that
the matter is not important enough for this3 and 1 have accordingly
compressed what I have tc say into as brief a space aa possible.

In his 2111 epistle Seneca says ‘quod Epicurus amico suo potuit ’
promittere, hoc tibi promitto, Lucili: habebo apud posteros gratiam,
possum mecum duratura nomina educere’; and he has kept his words ⁴
but 101 Seneca’s writings the name 01 Lucilius would have been unknown
to us. As it 11, we see himin a great variety 01 aspecta, for to him are
addressod the whole 01 Seneca's letters, the first book of the dialogucs,
and the seven books of naturales quaestiones, iu all much more than
half his extant works From these various sources we learn much about
Lucilius: his cognomen was Iunior, ha was procurator of Sicily during
the whole time that Seneca corresponded with him 3 of humble birth he
had raised himself to this place by his own mariis: ‘in medium te pro-
tulit ingenii vigor, scriptorum elegantia, clarae et nobiles amicitiae’.
He had seen much service, had crossed the Great and Little St Bernard
