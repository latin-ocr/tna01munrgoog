000180 foed. pac: Tae. hist. 177 end1v35 ‘multa paoe’. 282 clearly·
one or more vss. are lost here: probably more than one. 1 cannot
follow Jacob, who transfers 301 392 before 282, and then has to alter
both 301 end 282: he seems to me tc invert the poet’s reasoning, and
moreover the subjunctives 00000008, amaru, 0808001008 are then inex·
plicable. 284 tenues of β 10 undoubtedly true, 285 rigido cet:
comp. my correction of 182 ‘ponitusque 00 erigit ultra’t it seems pretty
clear that Aetna was mentioned in what 101008 before 282, as 80108000
talking of the various ways in which winds may get within the mouu-
tain. Lucretius in his brief description of Etna gives much weight to
wind; 808 our poet treats of it 08 quite inordinate lengthr he 800
already said much about it, and continues the subject for another 199
11000. 288 matteis tho last gain we get 100008, which ends here.
287 18 10 thus forced tc admit stom 011 sides different winde; 8000000 880
summit is equally exposed 80 011. 0001808 has 00 meaning here: 0001800·
seems quite necessary, the aar was absorbed in the following 00000, 00
1008 by abbreviation: 0091881000 passed into 091808 288 and then
instead of battling, the winde jein forces and so exert 0 greater power.
289 another possible cause: he now speaks of end illustratos the
effect'of moieture or water in stimulating wind or 010, which then in 180
turn excites something else, in the 0000 of Etna its fires: ‘or else the
clouds and eloudy south drive the winde inward into the mountainr' but
these vss. are very obscuro; and Jacob and others here go much astray,
illustrating from Lucretius what is totally different. 299 0 3rd
cause: flexere and ferarum· clearly refer 80 nubea 08 008. aru. ; I have
therefore for the syll. wanting written lc·; but, 00 Ι do 008 know what
our poet's usage would be, perhaps baec would be right 3 or' again 08,
‘when haply’, might better connect the v. with what follows: then flea
caput is obscure, though the general meaning is clear: ‘or else these
clouds, etc. wheel about and take the winde behind, and so drive them
in’: in 289 they met them in front: fleam eaput, for flauere ee, seems a
doubtful expression 3 so that perhaps Wernedorf 10 right in taking it to
mean have rounded, doubled, the head of Etna, comparing the technioal
‘flectere promunturium', ‘flea Leucaten'. 291 cada is the water from
the clouds: then this water presses, drives before it the airs and condensos
them with its blows and so 1000000000 88010 force: 2100000800 seems neees-
sary: I do not find 80000800 10 880 sense of ‘ streaming' applied to ought
but liquide, or speech. 293 now follow two illustratione from artificial
